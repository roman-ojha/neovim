=> For Autocompletion we will going to use 'nvim-cmp' plugin
  -> https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
  => Also we will going to nee other plugins as well:
      use("hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp") 
      use({ "hrsh7th/cmp-path", after = "nvim-cmp" }) -- Path Completions
      use({ "hrsh7th/cmp-buffer", after = "nvim-cmp" }) -- Buffer completions
      use({ "hrsh7th/cmp-cmdline", after = "nvim-cmp" }) -- Command line completions
      use({ "saadparwaiz1/cmp_luasnip", after = "nvim-cmp" }) -- Snippets Completions
  => Also we will going to use slippets engines:
      use "L3MON4D3/LuaSnip" --snippet engine
      use "rafamadriz/friendly-snippets" -- a bunch of snippets to use

  => After that you can use it and configure inside 'lua/configs/cmp.lua'


*) Add new completions:
  => You can get all bunch of completions here:
    -> https://github.com/topics/nvim-cmp
  => to use it you have to add it into the source list inside 'lua/configs/cmp.lua':
    ->   sources = {
            { name = "luasnip" },
            { name = "buffer" },
            { name = "path" },
            {name = "copilot.vim"}
        },
