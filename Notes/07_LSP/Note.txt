*) LSP (Language Server Progocol)
  -> Neovim supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which means it acts as a client to language servers and includes a Lua framework vim.lsp for building enhanced LSP tools. LSP facilitates features like: go-to-definition; find-references; hover; completion; rename; format; refactor

*) Commands:
  -> :LspInfo (to see all the running server)
  -> :Mason (to see package manager)

*) Setup:
  -> First we will add sum plugins:
      -> https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim
      -> And all of the plugins are mentions inside lsp plugins.lus
  => After that we will create the separate folder for lsp and write every things related to LSP
  => Also we will add 'nvim_lsp' as completion inside 'cmp.lua', we will add this to top because we want LSP completion to come first
      sources = {
        {name = "nvim_lsp"}
      },
  => So what ever server that we will install we have to put that into 'manson.lua' file
      local servers = {
          "lua_ls",
          "pyright",
          "jsonls",
        }
    -> Here every server that we specify we have to create a settings file of that inside 'lsp/settings' folder
